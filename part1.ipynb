      "### Internal CV Discrepancies:\n",
      "1.  **Impossible Overlapping Jobs**: The CV lists a role at **DataForge (2016 – Present)** and another as **Senior Engineer at EY (Current)**. A person cannot hold two separate, current full-time positions.\n",
      "2.  **Contradictory Timelines**: The role at **UrbanFlow (2010 – 2017)** overlaps with the role at **DataForge (2016 – Present)**.\n",
      "3.  **Illogical Career Progression**: The CV claims the candidate began a **Lead Scientist** role in 2010, two years *before* their listed PhD graduation in 2012. This is highly improbable.\n",
      "\n",
      "### CV vs. LinkedIn & Facebook Discrepancies:\n",
      "4.  **Current Company Mismatch**: The CV states the current employer is **EY**. Both LinkedIn and Facebook state the current employer is **PwC**.\n",
      "5.  **Current Job Title Mismatch**: The CV claims the title is **Senior Engineer**. Both LinkedIn and Facebook state the title is **Manager**.\n",
      "6.  **Employment History Fabricated**: The CV lists roles at **StartupXYZ**, **DataForge**, and **UrbanFlow**. None of these companies appear on the LinkedIn profile's work history.\n",
      "7.  **Date Mismatches**: The entire timeline of the CV is incorrect. LinkedIn shows employment at PwC starting in 2010, which contradicts all four roles listed on the CV.\n",
      "8.  **Educational Institution Mismatch**: The CV claims a PhD from the **University of Tokyo**. The LinkedIn profile lists a PhD from **KAIST**.\n",
      "9.  **Graduation Year Mismatch**: The CV claims a graduation year of **2012**. LinkedIn states the graduation year was **2006**.\n",
      "10. **Location Mismatch**: The CV lists **Singapore** as the hometown, whereas Facebook lists **London**.\n",
